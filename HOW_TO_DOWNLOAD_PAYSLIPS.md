## What the Buttons Do:

- **"Validate Calculations"** (Blue) - Just checks the math, doesn't save
- **"💾 Create Salary"** (Green) - Saves the salary record to database

---

## Troubleshooting:

**"No Download button visible"**
- You need to create a salary record first (Step 2 above)
- Go to Reports page - the Download button is in the table

**"Error creating salary"**
- Make sure you filled in: Full Name, Email, Pay Period, and Basic Salary
- Make sure you're logged in

**"Can't see the salary in Reports"**
- Refresh the page
- Check the Year/Month filters match your pay period
