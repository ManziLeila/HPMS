# HOW TO CREATE AND DOWNLOAD PAYSLIPS

## Problem: No Download Button Visible

The download button only appears when you have salary records in the system.

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:

### Step 1: Create an Employee (if you don't have one)
1. Go to **Employee Form** page
2. Fill in employee details:
   - Full Name: John Doe
   - Email: john@example.com
   - Phone: +250 788 123 456
   - Bank Name: Bank of Kigali
   - Account Number: 1234567890
   - Account Holder: John Doe

### Step 2: Create a Salary Record
On the same Employee Form page:
1. Fill in compensation:
   - Pay Period: Select current month (e.g., 2025-12)
   - Basic Salary: 1000000
   - Transport: 50000
   - Housing: 100000
   - Performance: 50000
   - Advance: 0

2. Click "Validate with Payroll Engine"
3. **IMPORTANT**: You need to actually SAVE/CREATE the salary record
   - Currently, the form only validates but doesn't save
   - This is a missing feature!

### Step 3: The REAL Problem

**The Employee Form page is missing a "Save" or "Create Salary" button!**

It only has "Validate with Payroll Engine" but no way to actually save the salary record to the database.

## SOLUTION: I Need to Add a "Create Salary" Button

Let me add this button now so you can:
1. Fill in the form
2. Validate calculations
3. **SAVE the salary record**
4. Then go to Reports page to download the payslip

## Quick Fix Coming...

I'll add:
1. A "Create Salary Record" button to the Employee Form
2. Success message after creating
3. Link to Reports page to download

Give me a moment to implement this!
